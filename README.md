# WellSucker
This project is dedicated to the development of silicone inserts in culture plastic. These will block cells from growing in a particular area, after which they are removed and it becomes possible to study the migration of cells to an empty site. I tried just flat silicone pieces, but they didn't hold well, especially in liquid. So now these things are arranged like suction cups.

To make such inserts, you need to print a mold on an MSLA 3D printer, and then pour two-component silicone into it. After hardening, the inserts are ready for use.
