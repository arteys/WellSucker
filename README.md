This project is dedicated to the development of silicone inserts in culture plastic. These will block cells from growing in a particular area, after which they are removed and it becomes possible to study the migration of cells to an empty site. I tried just flat silicone pieces, but they didn't hold well, especially in liquid. So now these things are arranged like suction cups.

To make such inserts, you need to print a mold on an MSLA 3D printer, and then pour two-component silicone into it. After hardening, the inserts are ready for use.

# 3d printing
I printed molds on a MSLA 3D printer (Anycubic Photon S) from a standard (Translucent Green) resin. For all printers and resins, different print settings are used, so there is not much point in applying mine here. Molds are printed strictly horizontally, flat, without any support. Printing at an angle greatly complicates the geometry of the parts due to the approximation of a complex shape by voxels, and the resulting inserts will not stick to the plastic reliably. Molds are designed in such a way that they are separated from the table without any problems.

# The choice of silicone
This is the tricky part. Staying in the ideology of accessibility and DIY, I used the usual model two-component silicone available in the hobby store.
Two-component platinum-based silicones definitely do not work - there is some kind of reaction between the silicone and the printed part and the silicone does not polymerize.
Tin-based silicones remain, they generally work well. However, not all, I have met at least one that sticks to MCLA molds absolutely tightly and then it is impossible to separate the finished inserts. Accordingly, if someone decides to make such inserts, silicone will have to be selected empirically.
I didn't use any separators because I didn't want to add their remnants to the biological medium.
